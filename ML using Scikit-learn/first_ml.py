"""
A machine learning model takes features as input and gives label as output.  For example, a machine learning model is given a picture of a cat. 
By looking at it's features the model has to determine if it is a cat or not. A cat has unique set of ears which the ML model already knows. 
So the model gives the ears as input which is also called a feature in ML term; 
by looking at the feature of cat's ear then the ML model lables the given picture as a cat.
